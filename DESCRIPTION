Title: Evolutionary Computing in R
Description: The package provides a customizable framework for evolutionary/genetic optimization of both single- and multi-objective continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. A set of predefined evolutionary building blocks and operators is included. Moreover, the user can easily set up own operators, building blocks and representations sticking to just a few conventions. The package offers both a black-box approach for standard task (plug-and-play style) and a white-box approach where the evolutionary cycle is written by hand.
